title: Why I started Programming and why you should start too?
---

So, before you start reading the blog let's know bit about me. Hi I am Atharva Pandey, a tech enthusist and a coder or maybe a programmer cause I like to write logics too and yes my bloodgroup is Python+. Well I am from Maharashtra, India and I turned 12 this January i.e 2022. So this was pretty much about me. By, the way yes make suresure to follow me on my github and subscribe my youtube channel I'll upload video about my coding project too! So let's get started with our today's blog post.

Many of us might be programming for some good money, or to have a high portfolio, or under family pressure or even you might be coding even in one of your relatives company under peer presure etc. Well how to manage all that will be covered in my next blog post surely but for now  let's get to know about my programming journey.

Once I was just at some marriage and sitting there down on the chair with some <b>Google Discover</b> blog post opened, I randomly scrolled all the way down the bottom and I saw some cool pictures of some really cool <b>Glassmorphism</b> UI/UX and I was astonished that it's real I litreally didn't knew that what is UI what is UX what do you call that effect(<b>Glassmorphism</b>). Well, I failed in finding the image I saw that day but, see the translucent effect here below

<br>And also, thanks to <a href="https://medium.com">Medium.com</a> for the image. So, Back to the story, I researched a lot about it and finally came to an end that all this was handeled by OS (Operating Systems), I beloved that UI and started researching it took me around 1.5 day to research and I came to realize that all that an OS was handeled by a Kernel and I started my research on Kernels, Now It was time to know how do they run? It was a really crucial and vital question to know the answer of and received some images and diagrams like this one below.
