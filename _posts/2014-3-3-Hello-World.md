---

So, before you start reading the blog let's know bit about me. Hi I am Atharva Pandey, a tech enthusist and a coder or maybe a programmer cause I like to write logics too and yes my bloodgroup is Python+. Well I am from Maharashtra, India and I turned 12 this January i.e 2022. So this was pretty much about me. By, the way yes make sure to follow me on my github and subscribe my youtube channel I'll upload videos about my coding project too! So let's get started with our today's blog post.

Many of us might be programming for some good money, or to have a high portfolio, or under family pressure or even you might be coding even
in one of your relatives company under peer presure etc. Well how to manage all that I will be cover in my next blog post surely but for now 

let's get to know about my programming journey.

Once I was just at some marriage and sitting there down on the chair with some Google Discover blog post opened, I randomly scrolled all the way down to
the bottom and I saw some cool pictures of some really cool Glassmorphism UI/UX and I was astonished that it's real I litreally didn't knew that what
is UI what is UX what do you call that effect(<b>Glassmorphism</b>). Well, I failed in finding the image I saw that day but, see the translucent effect here below.
